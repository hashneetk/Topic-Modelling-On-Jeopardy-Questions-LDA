# Topic-Modelling-On-Jeopardy-Questions-LDA
<h1> Goal <h1>

The goal of this porject is to analyze topics of the questions asked in the game show Jeopardy! based on the year, round and the monetary value of the questions using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. LDA an unsupervised generative statistical machine learning model that views documents(questions in this case) as bags of words. The dataset consists of questions asked on the show between the year 1984 - 2012 and during different rounds levels through the show. For this project we will only be using the questions asked during the Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy! rounds.
